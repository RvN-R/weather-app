# Welcome to my Weather App project!

I wanted to improve my understanding of React and in doing so, increase my experience in calling to API’s, the result was the “Weather App”. This project allows users to type in the name of their city and recieve a seven day weather report displaying all the usual information you would expect to see including highest/lowest temperture, pressure, humidity and weather icons assocaited with the report.
